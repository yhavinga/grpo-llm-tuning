**1. `easydel.scripts.finetune.gsm8k_grpo` Explained**

This is a script within EasyDeL specifically designed for fine-tuning language models on the GSM8K dataset using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

* **GSM8K:** This dataset consists of grade school math word problems, making it suitable for training models on mathematical reasoning.
* **GRPO:** This is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that compares multiple generated responses to a prompt and updates the model to prefer higher-rewarding answers.  It's particularly useful when you don't have a readily available reward model, but can use a heuristic or other function to judge the quality of different responses (e.g., correct answer, steps provided, clarity).

The script takes care of:

* Loading the specified base language model.
* Loading and preparing the GSM8K dataset.
* Setting up the GRPO training loop.
* Evaluating the model's performance.
* Saving checkpoints.


**3. Using Your Own Dataset and Reward Model with GRPO**

While `gsm8k_grpo` is designed for GSM8K, EasyDeL's `GRPOTrainer` class is more general.  Here's how to use it with your own data and rewards:


```python
import easydel as ed
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# 1. Load your dataset (ensure it has a "prompt" field)
dataset = load_dataset("your_dataset_name", split="train")

# 2. Load your base model 
model = ed.AutoEasyDeLModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your_model_name")

# 3. Load Tokenizer 
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your_model_name")

# 4. Define your reward function(s)
def my_reward_function(completions, prompts, **kwargs):
  # Calculate rewards (values between 0 and 1 ideally) for each completion
  rewards = []
  for completion, prompt in zip(completions, prompts):
      # Your logic to assess quality of completion
      if "good_keyword" in completion:
          rewards.append(1.0)
      elif "bad_keyword" in completion:
          rewards.append(0.0)
      else:
          rewards.append(0.5)
  return rewards

# 5. Set up vInference for generation with sampling
inference = ed.vInference(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_new_tokens=128,  # Adjust as needed
    num_return_sequences=4,  # Number of generations per prompt
    temperature=0.7,       # Sampling temperature
    top_p=0.9              # Top-p sampling
)

# 6. Create GRPO config
grpo_config = ed.GRPOConfig(
    model_name="my_grpo_model",
    save_directory="my_grpo_checkpoint",
    # ... other GRPO parameters
)

# 7. Initialize and train the GRPOTrainer
trainer = ed.GRPOTrainer(
    arguments=grpo_config,
    vinference=inference,
    model=model,
    reward_funcs=my_reward_function, # Or a list of reward functions
    train_dataset=dataset,
    processing_class=tokenizer
)

trainer.train()
```

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Dataset:** Replace `"your_dataset_name"` with the path or name of your dataset. Make sure your dataset has a `"prompt"` field (and optionally others your reward function needs).
* **Reward Function:**  The `my_reward_function` example shows a simple heuristic.  You can replace this with any function that takes lists of `completions` and `prompts` and returns a list of numerical `rewards` (ideally normalized between 0 and 1).  If you have a trained reward model, you would call your reward model here to get the scores.  If you have multiple reward functions, provide a *list* of callables to the `reward_funcs` argument of the trainer. If you are using a reward model, make sure to set `reward_processing_classes` equal to the tokenizer used during reward model training.
* **vInference:** This object handles text generation within the trainer. Adjust `max_new_tokens`, `num_return_sequences`, and sampling parameters as needed.
* **GRPOConfig:**  Configure the GRPO parameters (like beta, learning rate) in `grpo_config`.
* **Trainer:** The `GRPOTrainer` orchestrates the GRPO training using your dataset, model, and reward function.


**4. GRPO Training Loop Internals**

Let's delve into the inner workings of the GRPO training loop in EasyDeL, clarifying the "group" aspect, inference process, and weight updates.

The GRPO training loop, orchestrated by the `GRPOTrainer`, iterates over epochs and batches of data, performing the following steps:

1.  **Batch Preparation:** A batch of data is fetched from the training dataloader. This batch primarily contains prompts.

2.  **Input Preprocessing:** The `_preprocess_batch_input` method (overridden in `GRPOTrainer`) adjusts the batch and performs necessary data transformations before the main training step. This step also calculates reference log probabilities. Critically, it uses the `vInference` object to generate multiple completions for *each prompt* in the batch. This results in a set of "candidate" completions.

3.  **Reward Calculation:** For each candidate completion, the provided `reward_funcs` (or `reward_model`) are called to assess the quality of the completion. This produces a numerical reward score for each completion. Multiple reward functions can be used, in which case their outputs are usually combined (e.g., summed, weighted average).

4.  **Advantage Calculation:** The "advantage" of a completion within a group is calculated. Here's where the "group" aspect comes in:

    *   **Groups:** In GRPO, a "group" refers to the set of candidate completions generated from the *same prompt*. This grouping is crucial for relative preference learning.
    *   **Advantage:** The advantage of a completion is a measure of how much better it is compared to other completions within its group. A common way to calculate advantage is to subtract the mean reward of the group from the individual completion's reward. This centers the rewards within each group, making the training more stable and focusing on relative preferences.

5.  **Loss Computation:** The GRPO loss is calculated based on the advantages and log probabilities of the completions. The loss function aims to maximize the probability of higher-advantage completions within each group.

6.  **Gradient Calculation and Update:** Gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters are calculated using JAX's autograd functionality. These gradients are then used to update the model's weights via an optimizer (like AdamW). Gradient accumulation can be used to effectively increase batch size by accumulating gradients over multiple steps before updating.

7.  **Reference Model Syncing (Optional):** If enabled, the weights of a separate reference model are periodically synchronized with the main model being trained. This helps prevent the trained model from deviating too far from the original distribution of responses and improves stability.


**Inference and Weight Update Details**

*   **Inference:** As mentioned in step 2, the `vInference` object is used to generate multiple completions for each prompt. This happens during the preprocessing stage (`_preprocess_batch_input`) *before* the main training step (`grpo_step`). `vInference` uses JAX's JIT compilation features for efficient generation. You can control the number of generated completions per prompt (`num_return_sequences`) and the sampling behavior (temperature, top-k/top-p) through `vInference`'s configuration.
*   **Weight Updates:** The model's weights are updated based on the calculated gradients of the GRPO loss, as explained in step 6. The loss encourages the model to assign higher probabilities to completions with larger advantages within their respective groups. The key idea is that by comparing responses *within a group* derived from the same prompt, the model learns to generate completions that are relatively preferred by the reward function(s), even if the absolute reward values are noisy or have biases.


This detailed explanation should help you set up your TPU, understand the GRPO script, adapt it for custom datasets and reward models, and grasp the internal workings of the training loop. Remember to consult the EasyDeL documentation for more information and advanced configurations.
